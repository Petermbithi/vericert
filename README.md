# vericert
#web application that can be used by job seekers, employers and institutions to verify certificates and apply for jobs.
#In the project we have developed a prototype which is used as SaaS to provide certificate verification.  Verification is the process of establishing the truth, accuracy or validity of something such as the verification of official documents. The system allows users to make request to get academic certificates verified by filling the name of institution, course name, year of graduation and the reference code.
